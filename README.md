# Sales_and_Customer_Data_Analysis
The project consists of the analysis of sales data (+30,000 records) from an online store in India, using the Excel tool. Data cleaning and processing was carried out using formulas and functions to ensure data integrity. Subsequently, pivot tables and graphs were created to present the results of the analysis in a dashboard.
